# Hill Programming Language ⛰️

The Hill Programming Language is a C-Like general purpose programming language mainly created for self educational purposes

It is being created with the Go Programming Language, for now it is not compiled but in future it will be.

I don't know what to say. 
Here's an example:

fnc int main() 

{

// This is a comment

Writeln("Hello World");

var bool shouldClose = false;    
if (shoulClose) 
{
     return 1;
}

return 0;   // --> "0" means the program was terminated succesfully. If you return 1 the program will stop and can be used to handle errors
    
}
